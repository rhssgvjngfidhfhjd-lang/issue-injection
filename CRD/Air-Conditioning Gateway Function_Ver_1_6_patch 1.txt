1-4. control logic
  In this paper, the control logic is composed of "control block diagram," "control function (algorithm)," and "output
  setting."
  Readability shall be given the highest priority when describing control logic.
  Such notation may be used.

  In the figure, the control function is placed in the center, and the input (element data of processing) is shown on
  the left side, and the output (data calculated by processing) is shown on the right side.
  The notation used in the figure is shown in the following table.

1-4-2. Control functions (algorithms)
  The items described in the control function shall be updated every cycle. In this paper, tables are used to explain
  control functions.
  The table mainly contains columns for Priority, condition, logic, and output name, and each meaning and use are
  shown in the table.
  If the control function does not require Priority and logic, the Priority and logic columns are not specified.

1-4-3. Output Settings
  In this paper, the following table is used to explain the output in the control block diagram.
  The table mainly contains columns for items (of output names), range of use, resolution, initial value, period, and
  processing. The table shows the meaning and use of each column.

  In this chapter, the air-conditioning gateway control is explained in each section.
(1)control objective
  ・Based on the operation information in IDS and remote function, the drive of ventilated seat ECU and steering
heater ECU is controlled.
  ・The actual operation state and failure state are received from the ventilated seat ECU and the steering heater
ECU, and the display is instructed to the IDS (the customer is notified).


(2)control overview
  ・CAN signals by operation in IDS and remote function are converted into LIN signals and transmitted to
ventilated seat ECU and steering heater ECU.
  ・LIN signals from ventilated seat ECU and steering heater ECU are converted into CAN signals and transmitted
to IDS.

3-1-1. Gateway/arbitration function (CAN communication →LIN communication conversion)
(1)control objective
  Based on operation information by IDS and remote operation information, the drive of ventilated seat ECU and
steering heater ECU is controlled.
(2)control overview
  The CAN signal by the operation in IDS is converted into the LIN signal, and it is transmitted to ventilated seat
ECU and steering heater ECU. Operation information in IDS and remote operation information are arbitrated and
transmitted to ventilated seat ECU and steering heater ECU.
  Regarding ventilated seats and seat heaters, the way of thinking of driver's seat side and passenger's seat side
changes depending on whether driver's seat of a vehicle is on right or left, but it is not discriminated by control,
since it can be discriminated by changing harness connection destination of ventilated ECU.


The following figure shows the relationship between the air conditioning gateway function that receives operation
information from IDS and the remote air conditioning function that receives remote operation.
In this specification, IDS operation and remote operation are arbitrated and transmitted to ventilated seat ECU and
steering heater ECU.

    *1 For the trigger information of the switch operation in IDS, the corresponding signal is output for the specified
time only when the operation changes.
    For example, when the seat heater is operated to Mid⇒Hi, information of Hi is transmitted from the IDS for a
    fixed time, and after the lapse of a fixed time, a $0: no operation signal is transmitted.

(6)Control functions (algorithms)
  The CAN signal by IDS operation is converted into the LIN signal and transmitted to each ECU by the method
shown in Table 3-1 6~3-1-10.


  ■ventilated seat
  The CAN signal received from the IDS is converted into the LIN signal and transmitted to the ventilated sheet
ECU. And, the ventilated sheet is stopped, when the injection and drainage mode notice is received from IDS, to
prevent the battery rising. The LIN signal is transmitted to the ventilated seat ECU according to the remote
operation state received from the DCM.
  Since the switch operation in the IDS is trigger information, the corresponding signal is output for the specified
time only when the operation changes. Since continuous signal transmission is required for driving the ECU, the
signal shall be output according to Table 3-1-6, 3-1-7, Figure 3-1-3, Figure 3-1-4.
  If the preconditions and judgment conditions are not satisfied in each state, the previous value shall be output
without performing state transition.

  ■Sheet heater
  The CAN signal received from the IDS is converted into the LIN signal and transmitted to the ventilated sheet ECU. And, the sheet heater is stopped when the spouting/drainage mode notice is received from the IDS to prevent the battery from rising. The LIN signal is transmitted to the ventilated seat ECU according to the remote operation state received from the DCM.
  Since the switch operation in the IDS is trigger information, the corresponding signal is output for the specified time only when the operation changes. Since continuous signal transmission is required for driving the ECU, the signal shall be output according to Table 3-1-8, Table 3-1-9, and Figures 3-1-5 to 3-1-7. When the ventilated sheet ECU sends a request to start the heating process to the IDS without first sending a request to stop other communications to the IDS, the ventilated sheet ECU shall reject the process initiation and report a sequence error.
  If the preconditions and judgment conditions are not satisfied in each state, the previous value shall be output without performing state transition.

  ■Steering heater
  The CAN signal received from the IDS is converted into the LIN signal and transmitted to the steering heater
ECU.
  When the injection/drainage mode notification is received from the IDS, the steering heater is stopped to prevent
the battery from rising.
  The LIN signal is transmitted to the steering heater ECU according to the remote operation state received from
the DCM.
  When the specified time has elapsed from the start of operation of the steering heater, the operation of the
steering heater shall be turned OFF.
  Since the switch operation in the IDS is trigger information, the corresponding signal is output for the specified
time only when the operation changes. Since continuous signal transmission is required for driving the ECU, the
signal shall be output according to Table 3-1-10 and Figures 3-1-8 to 3-1-10.
  If the preconditions and judgment conditions are not satisfied in each state, the previous value shall be output
without performing state transition.

(6)Control functions (algorithms)
  Convert the LIN signals received from each ECU to CAN signals and transmit them to the IDS by the method
shown in Table 3-1 19~3-1-26.


  ■ventilated seat
  The LIN signal of the operation information received from the ventilated seat ECU is converted into CAN
information and transmitted to the IDS.
